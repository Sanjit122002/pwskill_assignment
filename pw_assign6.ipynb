    "Q.1 What is exception in python write the diffrance between exception and syntex error?\n",
    "Ans - In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception, which interrupts the normal flow of the program and transfers control to an exception handler. Exceptions allow you to handle errors and unexpected situations gracefully, rather than abruptly terminating the program."

    "Q.2 What happend when exception is not handled in python ?explain with example\n",
    "When an exception is not handled in Python, it leads to an unhandled exception, which causes the program to terminate abruptly. The default behavior in Python is to print a traceback message that shows the exception type, the line of code where the exception occurred, and the call stack leading to that point. After printing the traceback, the program exits, and any remaining code or operations are not executed."
