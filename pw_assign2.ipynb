    "Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Variables in python is like a continer which contain the values in python we do't need to intitialize it with data type like other programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "When initializing variables in Python, there are a few rules and conventions to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable Names: Choose meaningful and descriptive names for your variables to improve code readability. Variable names can consist of letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_). They should start with a letter or an underscore but cannot start with a digit. Python is case-sensitive, so 'myVariable' and 'myvariable' would be treated as two different variables.\n",
    "Avoid Reserved Words: Do not use reserved words or keywords as variable names since they have predefined meanings in Python. For example, you cannot use if, while, for, def, class, or import as variable names.\n",
    "Initialization: It is not mandatory to initialize variables at the time of declaration. However, it's good practice to initialize variables with an initial value to avoid potential errors or confusion. Uninitialized variables will have a default value of None until assigned a value.\n",
    "Dynamic Typing: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you can assign values of different types to the same variable. You don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable, as Python determines it based on the assigned value. For example, x = 5 will create an integer variable, while x = \"Hello\" will create a string variable.\n",
    "Constants: In Python, there is no strict concept of constants. However, it is conventionally followed to use uppercase names to indicate that a variable's value should not be changed. Although the value can still be modified, it signals to other developers that it is intended to be constant. For example, PI = 3.14159.\n",
    "Reassignment: You can assign a new value to an existing variable at any point in your code. Python allows variables to be reassigned with values of different types. For example, you can assign an integer value initially and later assign it a string value.\n",
    "Scope: Variables have a scope, which defines where they can be accessed. Variables declared within a function have local scope and are only accessible within that function. Variables declared outside any function, at the module level, have global scope and can be accessed throughout the module."
