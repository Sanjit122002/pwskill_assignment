    "Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "Note: Here Exception class refers to the base class for all the exceptions.\n",
    "The Exception class serves as the base class for all built-in and user-defined exceptions. When creating a custom exception, it is important to inherit from the Exception class or one of its subclasses for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency and Compatibility: Inheriting from the Exception class ensures that your custom exception follows the same structure and behavior as other built-in exceptions in Python. It allows your custom exception to be compatible with existing exception handling mechanisms and conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Hierarchy: The Exception class is at the top of the exception hierarchy in Python. By inheriting from it, your custom exception becomes a part of this hierarchy, making it easier to organize and categorize exceptions based on their relationships and common behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Handling: Inheriting from the Exception class allows you to handle your custom exception in a general catch-all manner by catching the Exception base class itself. It provides a consistent way to handle all exceptions, including your custom exception, in a single except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Clarity and Readability: Using the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions helps to make your code more readable and understandable for other developers. It clearly indicates that the class is intended to be an exception and follows the established exception hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the usage of the Exception class as the base class for a custom exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the CustomException class is defined as a subclass of the Exception class. By inheriting from Exception CustomException gains all the properties and behaviors of the base class, including the ability to be caught by a general except block handling Exception instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the Exception class as the base class for custom exceptions, you ensure that your exceptions align with established Python exception handling practices and facilitate proper integration with the language's exception hierarchy and mechanisms."

    "Q6. List down some best practices for exception handling in python.\n",
    "When it comes to exception handling in Python, following best practices can help you write robust and maintainable code:\n",
    "\n",
    "Catch specific exceptions: Catch specific exceptions rather than using a generic except block. This allows you to handle different types of exceptions differently and avoids catching unrelated exceptions accidentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use multiple except blocks: Use multiple except blocks to handle different exceptions separately. This helps in providing appropriate error handling and recovery mechanisms based on the specific exception type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep exception handling code concise: Keep the code within try and except blocks as minimal as possible. Avoid placing a large amount of code within a single try block, as it may make it harder to pinpoint the exact location where an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid catching and ignoring exceptions: Avoid catching exceptions without providing any meaningful error handling or logging. Ignoring exceptions can lead to hidden bugs and make troubleshooting and debugging difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use finally block for cleanup: Use the finally block to execute cleanup code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. It is useful for releasing resources, closing files, or cleaning up database connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid unnecessary exception handling: Avoid using exceptions for flow control or normal program behavior. Exceptions should be used for exceptional conditions or error situations, not as a regular control mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handle exceptions at the appropriate level: Handle exceptions at the level where you can effectively handle or recover from them. Let exceptions propagate up the call stack when they cannot be appropriately handled at a particular level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log exceptions: Include logging statements in your exception handling code to provide meaningful information about the exception, such as the error message, traceback, and relevant context. Logging helps in diagnosing and troubleshooting issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use custom exceptions: When appropriate, create custom exceptions to represent specific error conditions in your application. Custom exceptions can provide clear and specific error messages, making it easier to understand and handle exceptional situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test exception handling: Test your code for expected exception handling behavior. Ensure that exceptions are raised and caught correctly, and that the appropriate actions are taken in response to each exception."
